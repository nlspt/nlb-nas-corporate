The [Archives Online](http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/) portal is a convenient starting point for research into NAS’s holdings. Researchers can search for and view selected photographs, posters, maps, building plans, audiovisual recordings, transcripts of oral history interviews, speeches and press releases and find selected titles of government records on the portal.

They include (1) Government Records (2) Oral History Interviews (3) Audiovisual Records (4) Maps and Building plans (5) Straits Settlements, Overseas and Private Records (6) Photographs (7) Posters and (8) Speeches and Press Releases.
