This black and white film is one of the earliest audio-visual recordings and home videos in the collection of the National Archives of Singapore.  It contains, among other things, footage of a Peranakan bride.

The traditional Peranakan wedding lasted 12 days and consisted of various rituals and rites which reflect their values and rich culture. Some of the wedding rituals included: the *lap chai* ceremony which involved exchanging of gifts between the families of the bride and groom; the *chiu thau* ceremony, a hair-combing ceremony to initiate the bride and groom into adulthood; the s*ah jit* held on the third day of the wedding where the couple would pay respects to their elders and ancestors; and the c*hia sia* ceremony, where the bridegroom’s friends and younger relatives were invited to a celebration in the bridal chamber. Such elaborate weddings are no longer held today.

The traditional 12-day Peranakan wedding required different outfits to be worn on different days for the various ceremonies and rituals. Even for a modest wedding, a minimum of two ceremonial dresses would be required; at least one for the first day of the wedding and the other for the final day. The bride in the video appears to be wearing a *baju hock chiew*, a satin top and skirt embedded with gold thread. It would have been worn during the c*hia sia* ceremony held on the fifth day of the wedding.
