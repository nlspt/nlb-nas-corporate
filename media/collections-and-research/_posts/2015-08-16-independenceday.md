# INDEPENDENCE DAY?

The photograph of the first National Day celebrations (in 1966) is from the Yusof Ishak Collection. Singapore’s first President, [Encik Yusof Ishak, was a keen photographer](http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b374b268-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad) and his wife, [Puan Noor Aishah](http://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/photographs/record-details/b489d6d8-1162-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad), donated over 9,000 photographs taken or collected by them to the National Archives of Singapore. The photographs provide an invaluable record of their lives as well as a broader recollection of the events that took place during our early years of independence.

The photograph carries the description “National Day Parade 1966 at the Padang – Bird’s eye view of parade” but press release records show that the important day was very close to being called something else. As late as 30 July 1966, a Singapore Government Press Statement “announced for general information that 9 August shall be known as Independence Day” and this was how the press referred to it throughout much of 1966.

Then with just 5 days to go, a final decision was made to call 9 August what we have known it to be for the last 49 years – National Day.
