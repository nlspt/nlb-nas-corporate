It is the responsibility of the whole nation….National will is thus an essential political recondition of any convincing military posture of deterrence. Singaporeans must be psychologically prepared to defend our homeland. Thus even if a hostile ship from a big power comes steaming in with a huge banner across its bow saying, ‘Singapore here we come”, we must* *still try and be prepared to blow it up. At least, we must extract a high price from our aggressors.”**[1]***

The concept of Total Defence, which remains at the centre of Singapore’s defence planning today, was introduced in 1984. It was designed to integrate all segments of Singapore society into a united front for the defence of the country by expanding public understanding of national defence beyond military defence.

Total Defence addressed the modern reality that warfare was not confined to armed military personal but involved every aspect of society, which were as much at risk from enemy attack as soldiers were. It also highlighted that the defence and continued prosperity of Singapore was dependent on the joint-effort of all Singaporeans, not only active military personal or civil servants.
