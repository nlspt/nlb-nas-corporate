To find shared solutions to the security threat posed by Vietnam and the Soviet Union, Singapore deepened its defence relations with both fellow ASEAN nations and friendly countries with trade and strategic links with the region, such as Australia, New Zealand and the US. It also found an unexpected new friend in China.

Singapore continued its active participation in the Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA), its formal military alliance with Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Great Britain. We also signed a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in 1976 with fellow ASEAN member-states. While not a military agreement, the Treaty was ratified in response to the turmoil in Indochina, demonstrating ASEAN’s unity in the face of external threats.

The frequency of bilateral military exercises with friendly neighbouring countries was stepped up. Numerous bilateral exercises were carried out between the SAF and the armed forces of Thailand, Indonesia, Brunei, New Zealand and Australia. Joint military exercises also took place with Malaysia and the US.

> *“Our problem of adjusting to this world is to learn how we can anticipate shifts in the power balance…..This is our dilemma – a dilemma which will concern us in more and more parts of the world. A multi-polar world theoretically means a diffusion of power centres. In reality it makes for greater anxiety because nobody is in total control…..A stalemate is best for us – a stalemate which leaves us more years in which to consolidate our security, increase our cooperation and widen our options to choose our partners in economic development and progress.”**[1]***

Top level meetings were regularly conducted between our leaders and foreign dignitaries on Southeast Asian regional security. These included talks between PM Lee and US Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan, and landmark discussions between PM Lee and the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. The talks resulted in substantial improvements to Singapore’s security relations with the US and China.

Singapore’s defence diplomacy in the second decade encouraged trust, cooperation and cohesiveness between Singapore and ASEAN as well as its international allies. It served to isolate and deter potential aggressors, and was a key pillar of Singapore’s national defence.
